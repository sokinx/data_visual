# Data Visualization Project: Arrival Performance from 2015-2019
## by Maria Soccoro Ingco


## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis was taken from <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?pn=1">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>. 
It includes information on arrivals and delays in terms of total counts and time (minutes). Arrivals and delays were logged each month from 2015-2019.
Prior to the analysis, the dataset was cleaned by removing unnamed/empty rows and columns from the dataset.

## Summary of Findings

Delta Air (DL) was the top carrier while Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County (DTW) was the most utilized airport based on the dataset.
The carrier and airport distributions were normal but arrivals and delays distribution, were both highly skewed to the right.
The total number of arrivals and delays showed a significant increase in 2018 but the average arrivals per year did not had any significant change.
Flights arrived on-time ~80% of the time and the top reason for delay was due to national aviation system at 32.9%.
June to August are the busiest months in the year.
While Delta Air had the most number of arrivals, it was Eva Air that had the most delays.
Delayed aircraft caused the longest delays.

## Key Insights for Presentation

From 2015-2019, the overall on-time performance is ~80%.
The top 3 reasons for delay were national aviation system (which includes weather condition, high volume of flights, and closed runways), aircraft arriving late and air carrier delay.
Late aircraft accounted for the longest time delay, averaging ~3.5days.
Higher number of arrivals resulted to higher number and longer time delays.
